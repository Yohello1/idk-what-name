So how will multi-threading work in this program??

After some research I found out I cannot mutli-thread rendering & polling data :P
Those two things have to be on the same thread, now that makes this several times more annoying but eh

I plan on having 4 arrays that store the screen space data
1 array is being rendered
2 are being used to do the actual simualation stuff
1 array is being used to store the usr input until the simulation stuff is done being ya know
