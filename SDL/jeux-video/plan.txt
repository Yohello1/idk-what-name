Who knows???

(This section is dedicated to simulation)
ok so there is `pixel` which is gonna be used to do the actual rendering

We will manipulate data in new_version ig?
First it goes through the mix_user_input_one

Then when simulating it will check against the new_version one, if it doesn't change it just gets copied over to `new_new_version`

I think that makes sense???
Go look at the jpg file lol

TODO:
Make a mixer so we can make all the colour stuff happen before it's "rendered" so SDL is only showing the dots
Maps bigger than the screen
