Who knows???

(This section is dedicated to simulation)
ok so there is `pixel` which is gonna be used to do the actual rendering

We will manipulate data in new_version ig?
First it goes through the mix_user_input_one

Then when simulating it will check against the new_version one, if it doesn't change it just gets copied over to `new_new_version`

I think that makes sense???
Go look at the jpg file lol

Cause Im stupid
TODO:
Maps bigger than the screen
Smoke mixing (Use the wind thing for gravity/things going up)

Am I going to do newtowian physics? NO

CANNOT BE DONE IN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME:
Make a mixer so we can make all the colour stuff happen before it's "rendered" so SDL is only showing the dots
I dont have the time to get a PHD in like everything

FIXED:
Fix the sand only going one way
Fluid fixed
New method for weight and such, using density to move
Rework the physics system AGAIN to start using name spaces instead
