*  Game idea
A game about finding your identity through a journey
A journey during which you slowly uncover your past
A journey during which you remember your past, and it turns to define you
A journey which takes you through happy, and truely depressing moments
You'll be called many names during this journey, none of which stick particiularly much
Until one day a name someone calls you will stick, doesnt change as easily
You'll be known for the problems you solve, and people you help
