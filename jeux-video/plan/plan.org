* General Notes on coding style
- Classes:
  - All private members start with `_`
  - Public parts at top
- All functions
  - Either return a boolean, or are passed a logBase object for logging
* What a scene is
A scene is a collection of components
Each component has a:
    Position
    class
    Name
    Special properties

A scene file will contain a name of the scene, as well as other essential information
After some point it will contain 'name':'[sceneName]/[filepath to compontent file]'
The component file will contain information about the component
As much as possibly will be human readable

Scene file: x.pcsf : Poisoned Chlorine Save file
Scene name & file name must be the same!
Componenet file: x/y.pccf : Poisioned chlorine component file, x is the scene file, y is the component name

*  Game idea
A game about finding your identity through a journey
A journey during which you slowly uncover your past
A journey during which you remember your past, and it turns to define you
A journey which takes you through happy, and truely depressing moments
You'll be called many names during this journey, none of which stick particiularly much
Until one day a name someone calls you will stick, doesnt change as easily
You'll be known for the problems you solve, and people you help
But eventually, you'll be backstabbed by everyone you know
The colours using which the world is represented changes as you make decisions
