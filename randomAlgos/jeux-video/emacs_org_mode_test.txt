My favorite Scenes (in order)
1. The attack of Rohirrim
2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king
   + This was my favorite scene in the book
   + I really like Miranda ottoman
3. Peter Jackson
   - On DVD only
     He makes a really funy face when it happens
But in the end, no individua; scenes matter but the film as a whole.
Important actors in this film Arecibo
- Elijah Wood :: He plays frodo
- Sean Austin :: he plays samba
