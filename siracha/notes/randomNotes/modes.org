#+title: Modes

* Modes
- There are normally like >2 modes, but we'll just say there are 2 for simplicites sake
- The modes for a kind of 'protection' ring with multiple access modes
- The RISCV spec does not prescribe which modes must be implemented for a core, except for `M` which is Machine mode, the most priviliged mode
- Computers with only `M` mode are simple embedded systems.
- More secure systems have `M`, and `S`
- CPUs that can run Unix-Like Os's have `M`, `S`, and `U` avaliable at least
* SBI
- RISC-V's Spec defines the layer of software that is at the bottom of the RISC-V Software stack
- Basically a BIOS

* BIOS
- B: Basic
- I: Input
- O: Output
- S: System
* Privileged Mode
- This is what the computer starts in at boot time
- Any instruction is permitted, and no address access is considered a violation
- Once the OS takes control, the modes start switching between Privileged, and User space code
