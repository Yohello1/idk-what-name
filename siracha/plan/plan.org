#+title: Plan

- I am learning whilst going through this too lmao

* Libraries
- We want to build the OS in a way that it is portable for different systems.
- That's what we're gonna use libraries for!
- We'll have the system call a function like `write_uart`, and that will point to a function in a library. The library itself will do all the low-level, and device-specific stuff so we can abstract it away, and deal with it later
- To be clear, this is a problem for later tho.

* ABI
- what
