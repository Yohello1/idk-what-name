** Learning
- Basic exercises for ASM (x86, or RISCV)
  - Hello world
  - Write a program that takes a user's input string, and prints it back out
  - Redo the previous two problems with subroutines
  - Redo the first two problems with function calls
  - arrays
    - Write a program that lets a user input a series of chars, and puts them into an array
    - Ask the user for a position in the array
    - Output the character at that position
    - Repeat parts a, and b, but with integers
    - Repeat parts a, and b with floats
  - Bubble sort!
    - Write a program which lets the user input a series of characters into an array, and bubble sort them
- Jump tables
  - Write a program that asks a user for which exercise (function) they want to do (1-6), then jump to that thingy using a jump table
** Building
- Finish reading the RISCV book
- Figure out the ZSBL for Star64, and find the predefined address
- Figure out how we're gonna organise the memory
- xv6 is a very helpful resource
** Random research that would be nice to do
- How to turn the LED on the board on
- Figure out how UART would work
